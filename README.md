  -SYN             17. set SYNCANY: If set to 1, allows the modem to send data to all non-base nodes without finding the base. It is strongly recommended to
                   set the value to 0 to avoid unwanted data communication confusion on a multipoint environment._______Valid choices are: from 0 to 1.______
                   DEFAULT is: 0 _______
  -NODE_COUNT      # 18. set NODECOUNT: The total number of nodes._______Valid choices are: from 2 to 30.______ DEFAULT is: 2 _______
  --version        show program's version number and exit
  -p PORT          Serial port. Default: COM4
  -v VERBOSE       Enables extra information output (debugging).
  -tb TEST_BAUD    Test serial port for correct baud rate.
  -l LOCAL_RADIO   Work with the local radio. Program default. Can't be used simultaneously with remote option.
  -r REMOTE_RADIO  Work with the remote radio.
  -b BAUD          Choose our serial connection speed to the radio in baud If no baud specified, it will test. (factory default: 57600)
